============
TQA Workshop
============

This workshop introduces the `TQA`_ library, along with corresponding XBRL taxonomy topics.
Some XBRL knowledge is assumed, so the focus of the workshop is on learning TQA.

TQA is gently introduced through the use of code examples and exercises. The exercises have the form of unit tests that
must be made to succeed.

XBRL taxonomies are treated from the bottom-up, starting with plain XML and ending with taxonomy schemas and linkbases.
For each of these XML and XBRL topics, the relevant parts of TQA and the underlying `yaidom`_ API are treated.
